# Adult-Income-Dataset---Data-Analysis-Project (Python)
Project Overview:
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant columns.
Encoded categorical variables for analysis.
Standardized and normalized numeric columns to ensure data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed Univariate Analysis to analyze the distribution of individual features such as age, education, and workclass.
Used visualizations like histograms, box plots, and count plots to understand the spread of the data.
Performed Bivariate Analysis to explore relationships between key variables such as age, education, and income.

Visualization:
Generated insightful visualizations like pie charts, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Key Insights:
Univariate Analysis: Age, education, and workclass distributions were explored to identify the demographic and socio-economic trends within the dataset.
Bivariate Analysis: Identified significant relationships, such as a higher likelihood of earning more than 50K for individuals with higher education levels and specific occupations.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations and array manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and graphical representation.

Conclusion:
This project helped me to explore real-world data, practice data cleaning, and apply analytical techniques to derive meaningful insights. The analysis demonstrated how various factors influence income levels and provided a deeper understanding of demographic trends.
